Salesforce1 Launcher Chrome Extension
====================

### Launch Salesforce1 in a popup window

[Salesforce1 Launcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce1-launcher/kpcidnaepmjpicidmbjofolkmgliinie?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher) in the Chrome Web Store

Click the icon in your toolbar to resize your browser and launch Salesforce1 as a popup. 

When you close the popup, the browser will resize to where it was before Salesforce1 was launched - unless you have resized the browser since launching it.

**Note: this is NOT an official Salesforce project. Salesforce is not responsible for this extension.**
